Hello there.
I have just started on the project to build this blogging website using Jekyll and Sass. Jekyll is a
static website generator that has gained quite som popularity ever since [GitHub Pages][github] provided support for it.


[github]: https://pages.github.com/

Testing javascript snips:
{% highlight javascript %}
//This is JavaScript:
function HejHopp(arg) {
    alert (arg + "HejHopp!");
    }
{% endhighlight %}
