Hello there.
I have just started on the project to build this blogging website using Jekyll and Sass. Jekyll is a
static website generator that has gained quite som popularity ever since [GitHub Pages][github] provided support for it.
This is a hyperlink to the first blogpost: [Welcome to Jekyll]({% post_url 2015-11-03-welcome-to-jekyll %})!

[github]: https://pages.github.com/

Testing javascript snips:
{% highlight javascript %}
//This is JavaScript:
function HejHopp(arg) {
    alert (arg + "HejHopp!");
    }
{% endhighlight %}
