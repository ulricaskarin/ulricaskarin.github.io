#### What do you think of static site generators?

In this project the Static Site Generator *Jekyll* is used. Jekyll has gained quite some popularity ever since
[GitHub Pages][github] provided support for it.

I believe that Jekyll (and Static Site Generators in general) are great when building and maintaining websites.
It requires a minimum of effort but still provides the same functionality as most dynamic CMSs (WordPress, Joomla etc).
One may use templates, separate and include code from header, footer and much more. On top of that, SSG produced pages are actually faster,
more lightweight and more secure due to not having to rely on server-side code (which slows requests). Another great thing
is that static sites are developed locally. This fact makes the site both easy to preview and play around with without affecting the
live site. A neat thing about Jekyll in specific is that it lets you write your content in a simple markup language like
markdown which is generated to pure html. It sure makes things a lot easier.

#### What type of projects are SSG suitable for?

SSG are mostly used for blogging websites, but I do believe that one may use this technique for even bigger website projects
as well. It probably depends on the website purpose if it is suitable with SSG or not. If one wishes to include real-time
dynamic content within the site, Static Site Generators are probably not the best solution.
