Welcome,

to **a dev students quest**. My name is Ulrica Skarin and I am currently a student at the
Linnaeus University in the [web programming course]. My aim is to gain a deeper understanding within
the web development area and this is the website where you may follow my journey (if you'd like). Greets / Ulrica
