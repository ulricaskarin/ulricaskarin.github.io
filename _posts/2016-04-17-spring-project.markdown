Yet again, another short update!

This spring I am attending a course in individual software development. The goal is to develop a project from zero to
one hundred, getting the insights in how to go from idea to a fully releasable product! It is really
exiting, even though I am struggling at times. I have chosen to develop a flashcard application for the web (but of
course fully mobile compatible as well) using the MEAN-stack. I am having so much fun and I promise to put the link out
here when I've released the application for real.

Parallel with the project I am also attending a course in C-sharp. Last spring I attended a course in
server-side languages (main focus on PHP) and had a real hard time understanding the basics of the .NET framework. Now,
it all makes a whole lot more sense and I believe that I am slowly falling in love with yet another programming language!
Why didn't I get into programming earlier? Well, it seems that I am now making up for all those lost years. For the
summer I hope that I may attend courses in C++, Python and game programming (nodejs) as well. I have applied to a lot of courses,
we'll see which ones I get accepted to.

For now, take care!
