I have just started on the project to build this blogging website using Jekyll and Sass. The project is a part of a
school assignment at Linnaeus University. Jekyll is a static website generator that has gained quite som popularity
ever since [GitHub Pages][github] provided support for it and I am pretty excited to learn more about it.

To get started with the project we got a kick-off lecture about Static Site Generators and CSS preprocessors. You may
watch this lecture here: [Static Site Generators and CSS lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT5ooePvFEE) (in Swedish).
Take care, Ulrica
