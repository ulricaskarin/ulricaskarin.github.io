I have just started on the project to build this blogging website using Jekyll and Sass. Jekyll is a
static website generator that has gained quite som popularity ever since [GitHub Pages][github] provided support for it.
This is a hyperlink to the first blogpost: [Welcome to Jekyll]({% post_url 2015-11-03-welcome-to-jekyll %})!
