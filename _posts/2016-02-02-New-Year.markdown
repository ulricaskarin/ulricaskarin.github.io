So, a new year has arrived! In school the schedule is full. We have moved on from client based programming to server side
programming and are now learning how to **webscrape**! So interesting and lots of fun! Our base is JavaScript, Node.js and we
take help from different npm modules like cheerio and request. In time I will write more about it... As for now, there is not
much time for anything else than studies. Take care... :)
