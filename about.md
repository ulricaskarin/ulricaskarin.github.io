###... the site
This website is a result of an assignment in course 1dv022 - Client based web programming at Linnaeus University. 
*(Please read more about the program I attend [here](https://coursepress.lnu.se/program/webbprogrammerare/){:target="_blank"})*.
The aim was to use the Static Site Generator Jekyll in combination with Sass CSS preprocessor (scss) - in order to build a fully functional
website. This has been an amazing journey for me! I have learned a great deal that in the future will ease the process
of making a website enormously! I intend to keep this website going as a journal over my personal progress in the web development
area.

###... me
Well, how about me. My name is Ulrica Skarin and I am a happy mother of three living in Sundsvall, Sweden. Most of my life
I have been working in the health sector, as an ICU nurse. Technology in combination with humanity is great, and I have
really enjoyed my profession tremendously. All along, since back in the 90's I have had hidden dream of becoming something
within the web development / web graphics area though. In my spare time I have helped friends with their websites, drawing
avatars, posters for ads and so on. When I expected my third child I made a decision to finally pick up on this interest and
so I enrolled in different courses concerning code and web. This fall (2015) I started my current education to become
a web programmer at LNU. So far, I love it. It is a great program - always up to date with the latest web technology and
truly committed teachers.
